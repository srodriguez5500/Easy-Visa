# Easy-Visa
Project: Analyze the data of Visa applicants, build a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approvals, and based on important factors that significantly influence the Visa status recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.

# Skills and Tools Covered
EDA, data preprocessing, customer profiling, bagging classifiers (bagging and random forest), boosting classifiers (gradient boosting, XGBoost and AdaBoost), stacking classifier, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, business insights

# My Learnings
This project had a very rich dataset, in that it had many extreme values and many attributes that were strong indicators of whether an applicantâ€™s request for a visa would get approved. It was enjoyable to discover such correlations between features and visa application status. In addition, it was insightful to see how the model performances varied across the bagging, boosting and stacking classifiers.
